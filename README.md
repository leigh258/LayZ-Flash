Lay-Z-Spa Flashing Tool

To flash your ESP Lay-Z-Spa module, download the ZIP file and unzip to a location on your Desktop or Local C Drive; https://github.com/mossc001/LayZ-Flash/blob/main/flashing-tool.zip

Connect your ESP to your computer/laptop using a Micro-USB data cable; ensure that it's a data cable and not a phone charging cable.

Double click the "upload.bat" file, give permissions to run, then it will open a Command Prompt and flash the ESP. DO NOT disconnect or close the window whilst it is flashing.

Wait for the process to finish and the window will close itself.

Unplug your ESP from your computer, and plug it in again. Got to the Webpage of the ESP via it's DHCP IP and verify the upload is successful.
